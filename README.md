# NOTE: The high school tic tac toe code can ONLY be run in Runpython.org because it uses a library that is only in the Brython server
# I started this repository back in my high school programming class. It was the last assignment for the class; create a project consisting  of game or calculator. I decided to create tic tac toe. Using ggame module, I worked on this project for 2 wks. By the end, I had many bugs and errors. This lead to me turning it in because I had no more time to work on it and I hadn't revisited this project until recently. As I am pursuing a major in Computer Science, this little project had nagged in my head since I turned it in. It was an incomplete, truly awful program and I could do much better. So, I have no revisited and like to work on this project in my free time. The newer file is named "updatedTTT.py". Also note that the computer is not smart and chooses a random number from the list of the boxes that have not been taken.
